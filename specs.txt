Spec 1.
Program takes two pieces of user input in a form. First piece of information is a sentence or phrase chosen by the user.  The second part of the form takes a specific word that the user would like to search for in the previously given phrase.
Input1: A phrase or sentence of varying length, case insensitive.
    (Ex: "How many times am I going to loop through this loop before I'm done with this loop?")
Input2: A word the user would like to search for inside the given phrase, also case insensitive.
    (Ex: "loop")
Behavior: Should take both Input1, and Input2 and covert them both to lower case for easier searching.
Output: Returns both user inputs in lower case type.
    (Ex: "LOOP"= input, output= "loop")

Input1: "how many times am i going to loop through this loop before i'm done with this loop?" (lower_case_).
Input2: "loop".
Behavior: Should return true if user word for search is found in the given phrase.
Ouput: True

Spec 3.

Input1: "how many times am i going to loop through this loop before i'm done with this loop?" (lower_case_).
Input2: "loop".
